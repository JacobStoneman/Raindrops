# Raindrops

A method which takes an integer value as its parameter and converts it to a string based on the numbers factors.

- if the number has a factor of 3, output 'Pling'
- if the number has a factor of 5, output 'Plang'
- if the number has a factor of 7, output 'Plong'
- if the number does not have any of the above as a factor simply return the numbers digits

The method has been unit tested with a series of test cases to ensure it functions correctly.
